Because of that I've thought that my case concerns interaction of these tools. I've changed ESLint version, configuration and it did not help.`,

The goal was to force Prettier to apply proper formatting or let developer choose without changing config file. Let's say we have label tag following results:`,

After testing many different settings, I've looked at older version to check Prettier package. There was used prettier^1 and in newest update we've moved to prettier^2 (^ - caret symbol means newest version but taking into account that major version needs to match). It turned out that after  returning to prettier^1 problem was solved! Tags that did not exceed single line length limit could be set in two ways. What is the cause? I have my assumptions that are not confirmed but seems reasonable ü§î. Let's return to the label example and slightly modify it to picture the reason.`,

It might seem that Prettier should leave label1 formatting because when spreading that tag among 3 lines we didn't exceed row limit (80). It does not work like that for prettier^2. Label1 will still be formatted to label2. I guess that in prettier^2 there was change in approach to indentation counting inside tags. If we take a look again at label1, exactly on 6th line`,
