      value: `Patchron (initially named as Pepega The Detective) was wandering around my head once I've spotted Probot. I wanted to test that framework out and at the same time make tool that - once GitHub PR is opened - would perform basic code review for issuer. I didn't want to rely on compilers. I wanted to create my own logic of "understanding" received source code, depending on rule. After deep analysis of data structure given within hook, I've faced major obstacle.`,

    new Paragraph({
      value: `If issued pull request targets changes on part of source code, in hooked event we only have access to those code parts. Of course we also have few more lines per hunk header but most of the times, it won't be enough to determine context of analyzed fragment. There is option to request complete file from specific commit but such approach would easily deplete available resources (and most probably would result in a block). I've decided to accept such limit and continue on.`,
