After testing many different settings, I've looked at older version to check prettier package. There was used prettier v1 and in newest update we've moved to prettier v2. It turned out that returning to prettier v1 solved problem! Tags that did not exceed single line length limit could again be set in two ways. What is the cause? I have my assumptions that are not confirmed but seems reasonable ü§î. Let's return to the label example to picture the reason.`,

It might seem that Prettier should leave label1 formatting because when spreading that tag among 3 lines it does not exceed length limit (80). Well, it does not work like that in prettier v2. Label1 will still be formatted to label2. I guess that in prettier v2 there was change in default approach to indentation counting inside tags. If we take a look again at label1, exactly on 6th line`,

Prettier (v2) treats that indentation like it would be single whitespace character and because of that label1 has 70 characters instead of 90 which means that it didn't exceed limit and is formatted into single line. Once we return to prettier v1, indentations inside label tag will be correctly taken into account (correctly in the context of set goal - fix without changing prettier config file) and we will be able to write down label in two ways: label1 or label2 ü§†üëç. There is probably some setting in v2 to allows to change strategy but I didn't spend on time to find that out.`,
